# Tempo Worklog Highlighter

**Author:** Armin Schneider  
**Date:** October 2025

## 🧭 Introduction

The **Tempo Worklog Highlighter** automatically highlights your worklogs in Atlassian Tempo depending on:

- The **accout** that has been used in the worklog
- The **billable time** recorded

This helps you quickly visualize which worklogs are:

- Billable with billable time
- Billable without billable time
- Likely "learning" time
- Using "TATTEMP" as an account
- Using "ERRORACCOUNT" as an account
- Not billable

It also helps you to keep track of what you did in worklogs that are too small to display their description text by replacing the project key (e.g.: "TGA1234-12") with the description. This will likely affect logs that are 1h or less but above 15m, since these are too small.

### Added in version 1.3:

A dropdown above the comment/description section of the worklog popup will appear and previously given comments will be selectable for the user for easy input of recurring comments. The duration of how long the comments will be saved is adjustable and the whole feature can be disabled in the extension settings page or at the top of the script.js with `IS_DESCRIPTION_SUGGESTION_ENABLED` and `DESCRIPTION_SUGGESTION_STORAGE_DAYS`.

## ⚙️ Installation Guide

### 🔹 Firefox

1. Exectue the .xpi file in the "Extension" folder with FireFox (or FireFox based browsers)

### 🔹 Chrome

1. Download and install the **[TamperMonkey](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo)** browser extension.
2. Go to your **Extensions** (chrome://extensions/), find TamperMonkey and click **Details**

- Enable **Allow User Scripts**
- Enable **Allow Access to File URLs**

3. After installation, click the TamperMonkey icon and select **“Create a new script”**.
4. Copy the entire code from your local **`script.js`** file and **paste it** into the code editor (replace all existing code).
5. Save the script and **reload your Atlassian.net** page to see the highlights in action.

## 🎨 Customization

### TamperMonkey installations

You can modify color variables defined at the top of `script.js` to match your personal preferences.

### FireFox Addon

Click on the addon in your Toolbar and go to the settings page. Here you can adjust your preferred colors.

## 🧩 Default color meanings:

- **_Green_:** Worklog account is billable and has billable time
- **_Orange_:** Worklog account is billable but has no billable time
- **_Light-Red_:** Worklog account is not billable
- **_Dark-Red_:** Worklog has the "ErrorAccount" as account => has to be fixed
- **_Purple_:** Worklog has "TATTemp" as account => likely has to be changed to something else
- **_Light-Blue_:** Worklog is likely a "Learning" worklog

## Technical Details

FireFox is an Addon, because ~50% of FireFox browsers where too strict for the script to work properly. I did not find a solution to that so I converted the script to an Addon.
Since the colors should be customizable, I added a settings page in the extension.
